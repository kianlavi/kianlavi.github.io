# the design portfolio of kian lavi
every year or so, designers get the itch to recreate their portfolio. this is my attempt at creating a living portfolio, that needs little to no maintenance. i've gone from WordPress junk to Hand-Written junk, now to Jekyll-based junk. now all that remains custom is this homepage i publish to [kian.design](kian.design)

## ok, so what is this?
it's really just one thing: a homepage that houses links to my case studies, which are hosted on Medium. my logic is that i have neither the time nor the energy to maintain a well-designed article view, so i'll just focus on making this homepage look and feel like a nice entryway to me, kian. 

## future me, how do i install this?
1. clone this repo
2. make sure you get the Jekyll gem, `(sudo) gem install jekyll; bundle install`
3. and that's it. you probably have to run the `bundle` command, but VS Code should remember how
