# the design portfolio of kian lavi
every year, us designers get the itch to redo our portfolio. this is my simplified attempt at a living portfolio. i've gone from custom everything, to this simple homepage i made using jekyll, sass, html, and yaml to house links to case studies on medium. everything get's published directly to [kian.design](http://kian.design)

# for future me: how to install
1. clone this repo and make sure you have xcode command line tools, `brew`, and `ruby` installed
2. install jekyll: `sudo gem install jekyll; bundle install`
3. you might need to run `bundle` once, but then run the server using `bundle exec jekyll serve`
