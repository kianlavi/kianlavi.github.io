# I wanna be the very best
Every year or so, I decide to wholly recreate my portfolio, for reasons still unknown to me. I've gone through many phases, from WordPress Junk > Learning JavaScript Junk > Jekyll Junk (currently). Each time I hope it makes it easier to update my portfolio, so let's hope this sticks.

# Installation
After you clone this repo, installation means two things:
- getting the Jekyll gem
- doing a Bundler install

## What does that mean?
    $ (sudo) gem install jekyll
    $ bundle install

And that's it.
